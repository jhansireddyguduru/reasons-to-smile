# Hello there,

Welcome to the OAsome blog.
This is a travel blog of a couple who guess what â€¦ their initials start with an O and an A.
They both really like travelling new places, finding out interesting adventures and take casual photos.

This blog also gives an area for friends to share some of their experiences or handy tips that they found out during their travel experiences!

Would you like to take a stroll around the OAsome world?

Then, follow along on our short adventures as we capture the planet!

# Why another travel blog?

Yay we agree, you would say all good, but why another travel blog? And truth to be told we thought about this some time as well, but we ended up deciding because:

- everyone has something different to offer in terms of adventures
- we think we have experiences that could be useful for other people, just like other and wil provide insights for us at some point during our travels.
- it is fun and you should try it to!
- we document our experiences in a beautiful and constructive way

# So who are you?

We are not your typical travel blog couple that is in another country every month or week or... We are neither digital nomads nor backpackers who wandering around the world, although we guess we both would love to try this out.
We work as statistician and computer scientist.

We are just a normal passionate couple living currently in Paris, France in their late-twenties that has the opportunity through two full-time jobs, saving money and much of desire to travel 3-4 times per year.
We have been in France for 5 years now but we are originally from Cyprus.

Our travel adventures involve every time a mix bag of everything: museums, ancient temples, wandering around the streets to get the feel of cities and villages, hikings, food and alcohol tasting, swimming, snorkeling, sailing, zip-lining and taking lots of photos.

We are no professional or anything. You could probably describe us best as amateur click happy more than anything.

We have not been to many countries yet, but we will try to provide details, tips and photos from our trips in Mexico, USA, Greece, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and some interesting tips about Paris and Cyprus.
