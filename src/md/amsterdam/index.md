# Amsterdam

Amsterdam is the Netherlands’ capital, known for its artistic heritage, elaborate canal system and narrow houses with gabled facades,legacies of the city’s 17th-century Golden Age. Its Museum District houses the Van Gogh Museum, works by Rembrandt and Vermeer at the Rijksmuseum, and modern art at the Stedelijk. Cycling is key to the city’s character, and there are numerous bike paths.

# Wine tasting

Besides the beutiful places this region has other experiences to offer, one of which is wine tasting. We didn't have any particular winery in mind so we strolled around with the car admiring the different wine fields before finally visiting the Vouvray cave for a wine tasting tour.

The area is well known for its sparkling wine mostly white and if you like wine then you will find for sure bottles to your liking. In addition there are many troglodytic caves and white chalk and limestone basements which create a magnificent setting for the thousands of bottles of wines that are aged there, hiding away from the light.
